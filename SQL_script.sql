FROM actor 
WHERE first_name = "Joe";

-- 2b. Find all actors whose last name contain the letters `GEN`:

SELECT * 
FROM actor

FROM country 
WHERE country_id IN (1, 12, 23);

-- 3a. You want to keep a description of each actor. You don't think you will be performing queries on a description, 
-- so create a column in the table `actor` named `description` and use the data type `BLOB` (Make sure to research the type `BLOB`, as the difference between it and `VARCHAR` are significant).
ALTER TABLE actor 
ADD COLUMN description BLOB;

-- 3b. Very quickly you realize that entering descriptions for each actor is too much effort. Delete the `description` column.

ALTER TABLE actor
DROP COLUMN description;

-- 4c. The actor `HARPO WILLIAMS` was accidentally entered in the `actor` table as `GROUCHO WILLIAMS`. Write a query to fix the record.

UPDATE actor SET first_name = 'HARPO' 
WHERE first_name = 'GROUCHO' 
AND last_name = 'WILLIAMS';

-- 4d. Perhaps we were too hasty in changing `GROUCHO` to `HARPO`. It turns out that `GROUCHO` was the correct name after all! 
-- In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`.
-- SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
UPDATE actor 
SET first_name = 'GROUCHO' 
WHERE first_name = 'HARPO' 
AND last_name = 'WILLIAMS';

FROM inventory
INNER JOIN film 
ON inventory.film_id=film.film_id WHERE film.title LIKE '%Hunchback Impossible%';

-- 6e. Using the tables `payment` and `customer` and the `JOIN` command, list the total paid by each customer. List the customers alphabetically by last name:

SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name, SUM(payment.amount) AS 'Total Amount Paid'
FROM customer
LEFT JOIN payment ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id GROUP BY customer.last_name  ORDER BY customer.last_name ASC;

-- 7a. The music of Queen and Kris Kristofferson have seen an unlikely resurgence. As an unintended consequence, films starting with the letters `K` and `Q` have also soared in popularity. 
-- Use subqueries to display the titles of movies starting with the letters `K` and `Q` whose language is English.
SELECT title, language_id 
FROM film 
WHERE title LIKE 'K%' OR title LIKE 'Q%' AND language_id IN
(SELECT language_id FROM language WHERE name LIKE 'English');

-- 7b. Use subqueries to display all actors who appear in the film `Alone Trip`.

-- 7h. List the top five genres in gross revenue in descending order. 
-- (*Hint**: you may need to use the following tables: category, film_category, inventory, payment, and rental.)

SELECT main.name, main.revenue FROM

SELECT a.name, sum(p.amount) AS revenue
FROM payment AS p
JOIN rental AS d ON p.rental_id=d.rental_id

JOIN category AS a ON b.category_id=a.category_id
GROUP BY name
)AS main
WHERE main.revenue > 4300 ORDER BY main.revenue DESC LIMIT 5;


-- 8a. In your new role as an executive, you would like to have an easy way of viewing the Top five genres by gross revenue. 
-- Use the solution from the problem above to create a view. If you haven't solved 7h, you can substitute another query to create a view.

CREATE VIEW GENRE AS SELECT main.name, main.revenue FROM
(
SELECT a.name, sum(p.amount) AS revenue
FROM payment AS p
JOIN rental AS d ON p.rental_id=d.rental_id
JOIN inventory AS c ON d.inventory_id=c.inventory_id
JOIN film_category AS b ON c.film_id=b.film_id
JOIN category AS a ON b.category_id=a.category_id
GROUP BY name
)AS main
WHERE main.revenue > 4300 ORDER BY main.revenue DESC LIMIT 5;

-- 8b. How would you display the view that you created in 8a?

SELECT * FROM GENRE;

-- 8c. You find that you no longer need the view `top_five_genres`. Write a query to delete it.
DROP VIEW GENRE;
